            <h2 class="title2">Approach</h2>
            <p class="para2">Between dream and reality, he creates pictures wich look like they escape from imagination, which disturb the categories of the material world. The better and the worst to get back to our world however, with eyes fed by fantasies and its craziness.
            He loves to explore the poetic value of the colective unconscious on his own: each picture relies on classical/weird visual codes and symbolism to express universal feelings. He's working on how our objective external world and our subjective iner realities can interwine; between private and public, our world keeps on being reinvented
